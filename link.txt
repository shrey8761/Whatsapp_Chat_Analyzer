3 files in project - 

preprocessor.py : The input we take is a text file consisting of the chats (group chat or personal) so we need to do some preprocessing and get an dataframe out of it. This process would be done in this file.
app.py : This would be the main file where we would be creating the streamlit app.
helper.py : We would be making some functions in this file that would be used in the main app.py file.
